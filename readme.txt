In this contained files, all starter sources are same except for driver.c
I have made a few addition to the driver.c, which are global variable for each
schedulers to reference from. These are global head node of the list and the total
number of tasks(processes) in each schedule.
So to compile correctly, you need to use my overridden version of the driver.c
NOT the original starter code driver.c
And there are each cpu schedulers also added in the zip folder
